# Snake.

this site is being developed to demonstrate what i have learnt so far on my codingbootcamp journey.

The site is aimed to be about the retro game snake and will include an info page about the game itsself.
a page that has an interactive game of snake on it which you need to enter your name to log it to a leaderboard and which generates a users score which also goes to a leaderboard
