    <h2>About Snake</h2>
    <section class="border">
      <p>
        Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers
        the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep
        the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which
        gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in the 1976 two-player
        arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to
        survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a
        single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food
        eaten—often apples or eggs. The simplicity and low technical
        requirements of snake games have resulted in hundreds of versions—some
        of which have the word snake or worm in the title—for many platforms.

          The original Blockade from 1976 and its many clones are two-player
          games. Viewed from a top-down perspective, each player controls a
          "snake" with a fixed starting position. The "head" of the snake
          continually moves forward, unable to stop, growing ever longer. It
          must be steered left, right, up, and down to avoid hitting walls and
          the body of either snake. The player who survives the longest wins.
          Single-player versions are less prevalent and have one or more snakes
          controlled by the computer, as in the light cycles segment of the 1982
          Tron arcade game. In the most common single-player game, the player's
          snake is of a certain length, so the tail also moves, and with every
          item "eaten" by the head of the snake the snake gets longer. Snake
          Byte has the snake eating apples. Nibbler has the snake eating
          abstract objects in a maze.
