    <h2>About</h2>
    <section>
<p>Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English)<br>
     is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. <br>
     The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, <br>
     or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.</p><br>

     <p>The different names of the game are more recent. <br>
        The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative word for 'zero'), the British name,<br>
         appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries.<br>
          The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884,<br>
           but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, <br>
           consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set,
            the number hit being scored".
            "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", <br>
            the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. 
            The US renaming of "noughts and crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.</p>
